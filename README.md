# Sarajevo-flat-price-analysis-prediction
Using data from www.olx.ba that have been scraped, data analysis and price prediction have been done using three ML algorithms.
After some basic preprocessing and cleansing of data, the best result gave Decision Tree Regressor with 73 % of accuracy on tasting data with 99 % of accuracy with training (obvious overfitting -> luck of data). Linear regression 65 % on testing and SVR regressor 61 % of accuracy. 

Raw data as well as cleaned data with possible features that i thougth would be of some use in increasing the accuracy can be found in this repository. 
Preprocessing of the data and algorithms in another file.
